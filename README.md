Day 1 – Exploring Verilog RTL Design Through Simulation
Experiment Objective
The objective of this experiment was to understand the fundamentals of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design using Verilog. The experiment also focused on learning how to compile and simulate Verilog designs using Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and verify the output through waveform analysis in GTKWave. A 2-to-1 Multiplexer was implemented to understand the complete simulation process.

Digital Design Verification
Simulator
A simulator is a software application that executes a Verilog design in a virtual environment to evaluate its behavior. It allows designers to observe how a digital circuit responds to different input conditions and helps identify functional errors before hardware implementation.

Design
The design is the Verilog module that represents the digital circuit to be implemented. It defines the circuit's logic, specifying how inputs are processed to produce the desired outputs.

Testbench
A testbench is a dedicated verification module written to test the functionality of a design. It applies different combinations of input signals, monitors the resulting outputs, and helps confirm that the design performs according to its intended behavior.

2️⃣ Simulation Workflow with Icarus Verilog
Icarus Verilog (iverilog) is an open-source Verilog compiler and simulator. It compiles the design and testbench, executes the simulation, and generates a Value Change Dump (.vcd) file that can be viewed in GTKWave.

3️⃣ Practical Exercise – Simulating a 2:1 Multiplexer
Step 1 – Install Required Tools
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
Step 2 – Compile the Design
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
This command compiles the design file and the testbench.

Step 3 – Execute the Simulation
./a.out
Running the above command executes the simulation and generates the waveform file.

Step 4 – Open the Waveform
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
The waveform can now be analyzed using GTKWave.

4️⃣ Multiplexer Design Explanation
Verilog Design
module good_mux (
    input i0,
    input i1,
    input sel,
    output reg y
);

always @(*)
begin
    if (sel)
        y <= i1;
    else
        y <= i0;
end

endmodule
Working Principle
Inputs
i0 – First input
i1 – Second input
sel – Selection signal
Output
y – Multiplexer output
Operation
When sel = 0, the output follows i0.
When sel = 1, the output follows i1.

5️⃣ Introduction to Yosys
Yosys is an open-source tool used to synthesize Verilog RTL designs and generate a gate-level netlist.

Yosys Synthesis Flow
The basic synthesis flow is:

Load the technology library using read_liberty.
Read the RTL design using read_verilog.
Set the top module using synth -top.
Perform technology mapping using abc.
Generate the netlist using write_verilog.

abc -liberty <library>.lib
write_verilog synthesized_mux.v
The synthesized netlist is then verified using the testbench and GTKWave.

6️⃣ Conclusion
Through this experiment, I learned the basic RTL design flow using Verilog. I understood the purpose of a simulator, design, and testbench, successfully compiled and simulated a 2:1 Multiplexer using Icarus Verilog, and verified the circuit's functionality using GTKWave and an introduction to Yosys synthesis. This experiment provided a strong foundation for further digital design experiments.
